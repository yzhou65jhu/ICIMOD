This document shows how to run a LIS retrospective simulation on a new domain. We use a 1km run for bangladesh for example.
1. Create a new simulation folder by copying the lis.template folder.

$ cd ~/data1/LISRUN
$ cp -r lis.template Bangladesh.onekm
$ export WORKING=~/data1/LISRUN/Bangladesh.onekm  #(This step is not necessary.)

We'll refer ~/data1/LISRUN/Bangladesh.onekm as $WORKING for the rest of this document. 

2. Check the file for the output variable list. The file is $WORKING/configures/MODEL_OUTPUT_LIST_RUN.TBL


3. Create new LDT configure file and modify it for Bangladesh.
$ mv ldt.config.example ldt.config.bangladesh1km

Change the ldt.config.bangladesh1km as needed. Some possible but not all suggestions are listed below.
1) Change the output file name.
Processed LSM parameter filename:  ./lis_input.bangladesh.1km.nc
2) Change the log file name.
LDT diagnostic file:              ./logs/ldt.noahmp.log
3) Change LIS domain and resolution.
Map projection of the LIS domain:   latlon
Run domain lower left lat:          24.115
Run domain lower left lon:          88.305
Run domain upper right lat:         26.315
Run domain upper right lon:         89.305
Run domain resolution (dx):         0.01
Run domain resolution (dy):         0.01


4. Modify the run_LDT.sh file and run LDT to generate the LIS input file.
In $WORKING/run_LDT.sh, change the ldt configure file name. In this case, 
./LDT ldt.config.bangladesh1km

Run LDT and check the log file and output file.
$ bash run_LDT.sh

Check the log file in $WORKING/logs/ldt.noahmp.log.0000. The log file should say "Finished LDT run" at the end of the file if LDT finishes without any error. Check the log file and see whether LDT reads all the files needed. 

Check whether all variables are in the output file, in this case, lis_input.bangladesh.1km.nc.


5. Create new LIS configure file and modify it for Bangladesh.
$ mv lis.config.example lis.config.bangladesh.onekm

Modify the lis.config.bangladesh.onekm as needed. Some possible but not all changes are listed below.
1) Change start mode, start time and end time.
Start mode:                                coldstart
Starting year:                             2019
Starting month:                            04
Starting day:                              30
Starting hour:                             23
Starting minute:                           45
Starting second:                           00
Ending year:                               2019
Ending month:                              09
Ending day:                                03
Ending hour:                               00
Ending minute:                             00
Ending second:                             00
2) Change the output directory and diagnostic output file.
Output directory:                         './Bangla/'
Diagnostic output file:                   './logs/lislogBangla'

3) Change LIS input file name (this is the output of LDT)    
LIS domain and parameter data file:     lis_input.bangladesh.1km.nc

4) Check the met forcing sources.
Met forcing sources:                	"GDAS" "LDT-generated"
GDAS forcing directory:       		./MET_FORCING/GDAS/
Generated metforcing directory: 	./

5) Check the output varible list file
Model output attributes file: './configures/MODEL_OUTPUT_LIST_RUN.TBL'

6. Modify the run_LIS.sh file with proper lis configure name and number of cores. 
In run_LIS.sh, change the line below.
mpirun -np 16 ./LIS -f lis.config.bangladesh.onekm

Run LIS.
$ bash run_LIS.sh

7. Check the log files and output files.
Check log files in the output folder specified in your LIS configure file, in this case, $WORKING/logs/lislogBangla.${number_of_core}. Check your LIS output in the output folder, in this case, $WORKING/Bangla/SURFACEMODEL.


8. Continue simulation with restart files.
LIS generally takes a considerable time to finish the simulations. The simulations can be interrupted by all kinds of reasons. When the simulation is interupted, we generally would rather continue the simulation than cold start again from the beginning. We can restart the simulation with restart files most recently generated in the output folder. In this example case, we output the restart file every month. Restart file output frequency can be changed in LIS configure file, 
Noah-MP.3.6 restart output interval:    1mo

To continue simulation with the restart file, locate the most recent restart file in your output folder, in this case, $WORKING/Bangla/SURFACEMODEL/201906/LIS_RST_NOAHMP36_201906302345.d01.nc. Change the LIS configure file as needed, including
Start mode:                                restart  #coldstart
Starting year:                             2019
Starting month:                            06
Starting day:                              30
Starting hour:                             23
Starting minute:                           45
Starting second:                           00
Noah-MP.3.6 restart file:      		   "./Bangla/SURFACEMODEL/201906/LIS_RST_NOAHMP36_201906302345.d01.nc"
